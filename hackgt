1) Inbox the game
and somehow gamifying Gmail to respond to email


Other game engines - libGDX, Starling, HaxeFlixel


2) a level maker version of http://jayisgames.com/review/silent-conversation.php
where the focus is less on touching all the words and more on just experiencing the words
very much a webtoy concept

- Game ends when you touch the last word
- Invisible floor?
- picture with words
- linear progression <- challenge this concept
- Rather than focus on linear progression through a narrative - try for exploration
	- hidden meanings?
	- play with juxtas?
	- different ways to fiinish level
	- 
- " Suddenly I'm thinking about my score instead of the story, whether it's worth it to restart just to get an A+, and 90% of the time it isn't because I don't want to start the story over when I know that'll make it lose its power. "



- removing the penalty parts, and redoing the "scoring system"
- Trying new music /  jump noises and sounds?

Stretch goals:
- upload your own texts
- having the game automatically arrange the text interestingly
- generic level maker
